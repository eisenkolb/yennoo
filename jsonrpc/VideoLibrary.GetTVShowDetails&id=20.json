        "plot": "A massive earthquake ravaged Japan's mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of it into the ocean. Ten years later, the story starts with Igarashi Ganta, a seemingly ordinary, unassuming middle school student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a simple, normal life. This all changes one day when a strange man covered in blood and crimson armour appears, floating, out of his classroom windows. Smirking madly, this Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class and, instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in his chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a suspiciously quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme-park-like prison.",

Being the only survivor out of the entire class, Ganta is charged with mass murder and, due to the overwhelming, and doctored, evidence against him and no way to prove his innocence, he is sentenced to death and sent to Deadman Wonderland's prison. As some of the higher ups plot to kill Ganta in an 'accident', Ganta meets a strange white-haired girl named Shiro, who manages to read his heart and understand him. When a bunch of bullies start attacking Ganta and Shiro, an explosion causes a large object to fall towards Ganta. However, Ganta's desire to keep living so he can kill the red man activates the powers that were implanted in him, allowing him to control his blood to save himself and Shiro.",

Ganta offers to help Minatsuki escape, but soon learns she is his opponent in the next Corpse Carnival. When the match begins, Minatsuki's personality changes completely and attacks with her whip-like Branches of Sin, revealing she had manipulated him into taking an injury prior to the match. However, Yō appears, revealing Minatsuki to be his little sister, saying that he plans to gain enough Cast Points to buy her freedom before entering the arena. Minatsuki tries to manipulate Yō against Ganta, but he turns on her instead, having learnt the truth behind his father's death. Minatsuki captures Yō and uses him as a human shield against Ganta, revealing she has shown hatred ever since her mother left her for dead during the Red Hole incident. Ganta manages to disable one of her whips and free Yō, before knocking her out with a headbutt, winning the match.",
