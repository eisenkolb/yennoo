Mary is still being groomed for a position at CSIS, though pressure is mounting to prove Reardon's value as an informer. Reardon tips Mary off that one of her wire-room operators is actually a mole working for the Chinese Triads, hoping in return Mary can help him in his custody battle with his ex-wife Francine. But with a mole in her wire room, the future of Mary's whole unit is now in jeopardy. And it doesn't help either Mary or Reardon when Bill suddenly turns up dead. Mary's Deputy-Director, Ted Altman, is pleased, wanting to undermine Mary as much as possible. Reardon denies involvement, but his own suspicions point to his impulsive brother, Michael.",
