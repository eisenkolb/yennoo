Along with its own personal army, Hellsing also has a few secret weapons. Alucard, an incredibly powerful vampire, has been controlled by Hellsing for years. Although he dislikes being a servant to the Hellsing family, he certainly enjoys his job as Hellsingâ€™s vampire exterminator. Seras is a fledgling vampire and a former police woman. Although reluctant to embrace her new self, she is still a valuable member of the organization. Integra Hellsing, the current leader, is usually fully capable of fulfilling her duty, but lately, vampire activity has been on the rise. Unfortunately, the cause is more alarming than anything she could have imagined...",

Having been counted as 'lost' at the Cheddar incident, she now serves for a group dedicated to the eradication of vampires. Though she seems to have trouble adjusting, many are tolerant of her, and her new life, though the tolerance only goes so far. And she'll soon have a chance to prove herself, when a new threat is discovered, in the form of Rafe and Jessica.\r\nThe two lovers are having a lot of fun! Killing families, using their blood to write obscenities and blasphemy on the wall - it's all good fun. That is, until their actions catch the eye of Hellsing, and particularly Arucard, who has no tolerance for the 'low-class' vampires. Seras' chance to prove herself becomes apparent when she's ordered to shoot Jessica, though she hesitates - Jessica's only a young girl. Would killing her make her any better, or make her worse than the monsters Hellsing hunts?",

And when an Italian college student is found to have a computer chip, which has apparently made him into an 'artificial' vampire, it raises more than a few eyebrows. Even though the chip is removed, the student revives, killing many on his search for his lover, who he was caught in the act of making one of his own. Hellsing moves to put a stop to this, but there seems to be more than one person interested in the boy.\r\nHellsing's agents are killed, and Seras is severely wounded. Not by the student, but by a man called Alexander Anderson, a member of the Vatican's section 13 - the Iscariot organization. Though having the same mission as Hellsing, the two organizations are sworn enemies, and when Arucard shows up, a heated battle takes place. One would think a human would be no match for the likes of a vampire, Anderson proves to have more than one trick up his sleeve.",

We learn that her uncle tried to take her father's place as head of the Hellsing organization, and in attempt to assume power, tried to kill off Integra while Walter was away (presumably on duty).  Integra recalls her father's words of her going to a prison cell on the bottom floor if she ever found herself in a moment of insurmountable peril.  There she finds Arucard, while at the same time found and attacked by her uncle and associates.  After being shot in the shoulder, her blood awakens Arucard, who quickly takes care of her uncle's goons, and recognizes her as her father's successor.  As her first encounter with Arucard concludes, she awakens from her state to find that the operation was a success... Walter has already set up her afternoon tea for her.",

Due to the vast coverage of the \"terrorist attacks\" and the required secrecy of the undead, Hellsing organization is pinned by an unknwon source in the media as the terrorist organization itself.  The British military is called in to stop these \"terrorists.\"  Fargason purposely gets himself killed so he looked like a terrorist, preventing the media from investigating the London Tower destruction any further, thus keeping both the vampires and Hellsing out of the public eye (for now). Seras Victoria is finally makes it to the tower only to see Fargason get shot.  After paying her final respects, she grabs her Halkonnen and rushes into the tower area.
