Determined to help his brother, Elijah leaves their sister Rebekah behind and follows Klaus. Elijah learns that the beautiful and rebellious werewolf Hayley - Klaus' onetime flame - has fallen into the hands of a powerful witch named Sophie Deveraux. When Sophie reveals some life-changing news, Elijah realizes that the Original family may have been given a second chance at humanity and redemption. Klaus, however, is more intrigued by his recent unexpected reunion with his former protégé, Marcel, a charismatic but diabolical vampire who now has total control over the supernatural inhabitants of New Orleans. Klaus vows to reclaim what was once his - the power, the city and his family.",
