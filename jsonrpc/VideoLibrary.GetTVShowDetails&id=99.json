        "plot": "Sergeant Detective Jessica King – Jess for short – survived eight years in Homicide, three motorcycle accidents, two marriages and every shoe style since the 90s. Will she survive her new job as head of the Major Crimes Task Force? Jess is a powerhouse and a force of nature, a cop who sees things that everyone else misses. She says what she thinks, and she never stops thinking – about a crime scene, about evidence, about the motivations of the suspects. Professionally and in private, Jess faces two challenges: to save her third marriage and to prove that she’s the best cop in town.\r\nJess’ unit takes over cases already in progress: murder, rape, robbery, gang violence, serial crime – the most volatile and challenging cases that the ordinary police force has failed to solve. Jess can take over any case in the city, whether the original investigating officers want her to or not. She gets to work with a different squad in every case – from the elite Homicide department to the intimidating hulks of Hold-Up, and from the rock-star heroes of the Drug Squad to the shadowy denizens of Organized Crime.",

But when the Drug Squad nails a wise guy named DeMarco for possession, they unwittingly take Homicide's only lead off the streets. Graci hands the mess to Jess, ordering her to solve the murders and bring peace to the cop shop. At the Don Jail, Jess identifies DeMarco's unlikely confidante, a biker named T-Bone, and promises him a break on his own assault sentence if he agrees to act as an undercover agent for the police. Jess puts her trust in her volatile informant, but when T-Bone goes AWOL, he jeopardizes the case and Jess’ reputation.",

Jess knows Seymour killed a teen girl five years ago but she didn't have enough evidence to convict. Jess tries and fails to trap her Moby Dick in a sting, but when she turns up nothing but circumstantial evidence, Graci takes Jess off the case. Or so he thinks. Jess goes rogue and tracks Seymour on her own using her team and some questionable tactics. Seymour loves the attention, and that’s when Jess makes the connection - he's a clinical narcissist and he’s taunting her. When another girl goes missing, Jess must rein in her obsession in order to save her before it's too late.",

Graci has Jess take over their ongoing investigation: the shooting of Scott Flanigan, an innocent bystander caught in gang crossfire at a skating rink. But when Jess discovers that Flanigan was actually the target of the shooting, the case blows open. Digging deeper to find a motive, Jess suspects the killer used the gang's notorious rivalry as a decoy for a crime of passion.",
