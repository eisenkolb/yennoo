They have not aged, and they are completely unaware of their own deaths. Camille and Simon assume they can rejoin the world of the living as though nothing has happened, but their return throws their friends and family into a state of turmoil. Camille's sister Léna has continued to grow up without her sibling beside her, and Simon's wife Adèle is just about to get remarried, to Thomas. Meanwhile, lonely nurse Julie receives a visit from a very strange little boy. Seven years ago, the town was struck by a series of bloody murders. Now it seems the killings have started up again.",
