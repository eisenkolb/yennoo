                "plot": "Artsy and eclectic Aria has just returned to town after spending a year overseas and, while she tries to deny feeling hurt over her father Byron's indiscretion with one of his ex-students at the college, and keep her mom, Ella, from finding out, she can't ignore the intense chemistry with Ezra Fitz - Aria's English teacher. Once-chubby Hanna has transformed herself into the current \"It girl,\" but still battles the urge to binge. Shoplifting gives her a less-fattening thrill, but when she gets caught, the charges are dismissed only because her mother, Ashley, takes matters into her own hands, eager to keep her own reputation and the image of her daughter untarnished. Spencer is a perfectionist and straight-A student whose pressure to stand out in her overachieving family leaves her feeling alone ... until she finds understanding in the unlikeliest of places - the arms of her sister's fiancé. Emily, an athlete trying to sort out her place in the world, finds herself drawn to her new neighbor, Maya, a free spirit who recently moved into Alison's old house across the street. When each girl receives a message referencing these most private details that barely scratch the surface of what they are desperate to keep hidden, living in their picturesque suburban community suddenly seems far from perfect as secrets, lies and betrayals threaten everything they hold dear.

As the girls try to pay tribute to Alison's memory, the four friends are faced with unresolved issues. Aria has an unsettling encounter with her father's former mistress, Meredith. Emily is forced to see Toby Cavanaugh in a new light. Spencer is reeling in the wake of a vengeful Melissa. And Hanna is desperate to have her boyfriend, Sean, forget the \"old\" Hanna. With \"A\" taunting them every step of the way, how can the girls forge ahead and leave the past behind? Meanwhile, Detective Wilden uses his new connection to Hanna and Ashley to his benefit. But will he get the answers he's looking for by making himself at home in the Marin household?",

Whether it's a family in crisis, parental praise for an undeserved honor looming over their heads or wearing totally unfashionable scrubs while working off a debt – the girls must deal with it all. And on top of that, \"A's\" lipstick message is still haunting them. Meanwhile the girls must also deal with typical teenage drama – the boy kind – when a new boy arrives and pushes the status quo, a secret love is tested, a new romance blooms and an old romance is floating in the grey area.",

With Hanna in the hospital and armed with the information of who “A” is, the girls are backtracking to figure out how they got to this point.

Will Hanna fall back into her old ways, or does she have the will power to stand up to \"A\" and her games?",

Hanna is having a hard time finding a job to help her family's financial situation, but when \"A\" has a job for her, will Hanna be able to refuse? Emily can only think of Maya and is desperate to speak to her -- so much so that she enlists the help of Caleb, the new bad boy in the school. And as an important piece of property goes missing, Spencer finds being in close quarters with her new brother-in-law, Ian, more difficult than ever. Meanwhile, Aria's former babysitter, Simone, comes back to town for a surprise visit. But what should be a happy reunion quickly becomes a nightmare for Aria when Simone sets her sights on Ezra.",

Emily must deal with a jealous teammate who is threatened by Emily’s return to the pool, as Aria and Ezra plan their first date out in the open. And Hanna is still stuck playing “A’s” game, but the next hurdle might just have complications for another Liar. With “A” pulling the strings and making matters worse, will the girls be able to weather the storm and lie their way out of it, or will they have to face the ugly truths? Meanwhile, Spencer turns to Ali’s brother, Jason, for information about the night they believe Alison died, only to have to face part of her unpleasant past with Ali.",

For Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer, keeping things hidden is second nature, but having to live with those secrets can become a big burden. How long can Aria be with someone when they can't go out in public? Is it a true friendship when Spencer and Toby aren't able to be seen together? How truthful can Emily be when she can't be honest about whom she wants to be with? And how can Hanna move on when she secretly still wants to be with the one who broke her heart? With someone like \"A\" out there to watch their every move, four Liars may not have to worry about keeping things hidden for too much longer. Meanwhile, Rosewood police officer Garrett Reynolds is keeping his promise to keep a close eye on the girls - much closer than they realize.",
